# ORDERS-DATA-ANALYSIS
In this project, I analyzed order data using Power BI to uncover key business insights. I built an interactive dashboard showcasing KPIs like total sales, order volume, customer trends, and profit earned. The report includes slicers, filters, and visualizations to support data-driven decision-making.
